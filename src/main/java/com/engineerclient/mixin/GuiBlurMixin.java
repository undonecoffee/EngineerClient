/**
 * {@link RandomStuff}'s "Blur In GUI": says where the frame's blur pass goes.
 *
 * <p>26.1.2 builds the GUI as a list of strata and {@code blurBeforeThisStratum} splits that list
 * in two: everything up to the marked stratum is drawn, the blur post chain runs over the whole
 * main target, then everything from the marked stratum on is drawn on top. So the marker is not
 * "blur this" — it is the line the blur happens at.
 *
 * <p>{@code Gui.extractRenderState} is the first thing to touch the GUI state after
 * {@code GuiRenderState.reset()}, so marking at its HEAD marks stratum 0 and nothing GUI-side is
 * ever behind the line: the blur lands on the world alone, and the HUD, the screen, its items and
 * its tooltips all draw afterwards, sharp. Vanilla's own menu blur instead marks at the screen's
 * background stratum, which puts the HUD behind the line and blurs it along with the world — which
 * is why this hooks here rather than reusing that call, and why {@code ScreenBlurMixin} has to drop
 * it: {@code blurBeforeThisStratum} throws "Can only blur once per frame".
 *
 * <p>Nothing here runs when the HUD is not being extracted (no level, so nothing to blur), which
 * is the other half of the condition {@link RandomStuff#blursGui()} checks.
 *
 * <p>Some HUD mods (gnetum's {@code wrapHudRender}) run {@code extractRenderState} more than once a
 * frame, and something else may already have marked the blur; the marker is only placed while the
 * frame's blur is still unspent ({@code firstStratumAfterBlur == Integer.MAX_VALUE}), or the game
 * crashes with "Can only blur once per frame".
