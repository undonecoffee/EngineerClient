 * Several dungeon mods (blade-addons, devonian, Odin itself) inject into {@code channelRead0} to
 * rewrite or drop system chat — terminal-completion lines in particular — and whichever runs first
 * and cancels hides the packet from everyone after it. Priority 1 puts this callback ahead of all
 * of them. It only reads; it never cancels or modifies, so it cannot affect what they do.
