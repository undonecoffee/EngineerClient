/**
 * The skill presets: who does what (a role per class) and when each thing is done. Edit them here.
 *
 * **Roles**: one line per class, its four sections split by `/`, in the usual shorthand:
 * - digits: terminals, in the order done (`43` = T4 then T3)
 * - `ss`: Simon Says (S1's device); `i4`: the S4 device (done in S1); `dev`: the section's device
 * - `ll` `rl` `bl`: left, right, both levers (which is which: [LEFT])
 * - `ee2` `ee3`: early enter into S2 / S3; `core`: into the core (after their other jobs)
 * - anything else (`recore`, `(leap to 2nd term)`) is a note, ignored.
 *
 * A job in two roles is a stack: if one of them is yours it's always yours; otherwise the first bot
 * listed does it. A gate goes to whoever has the section's `ll`/`bl`.
 *
 * **Times**: one line per section, `|`-separated groups of "jobs seconds" (seconds into that
 * section, when it's done). Jobs as in the roles, plus `terms`, `levers`, `gate`, and `lights` /
 * `arrows` / `i4` for a later section's device done early. A bot with several jobs at one time
 * does them evenly spread since its previous one.
 *
 * **Moves**: one line per section, `|`-separated:
 * - `i4 leaps 8.1`: the i4 bot leaps back into the section at 8.1 s
 * - `ee2 spot 11.2`: the ee2 bot is on its spot by 11.2 s (it walks there after its last job)
 * - `leap ee2 12.1`: everyone free pre-leaps onto the ee2 bot at 12.1 s (onto you as soon as you're
 *   there, if it's yours); the others right after their last job
 * - `hold 2`: the next section's 2nd-terminal bot waits on the early-enter spot (doesn't walk on)
 * - `ee3 waits 1 2 3 4`: the ee3 bot stays on its spot until those have leapt onto it (the next
 *   section's terminals by number, or `ee3` / `core`...: whoever does that); without it, until
 *   everyone free has
 * Bots that pre-leapt walk on to their next terminals; at the core, everyone leaps in at once.
 *
 * **Spots**: early-enter spots this preset stands on instead of the menu's (`ee2`, `ee3`, `ee4`, `core`).
