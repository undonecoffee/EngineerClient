/**
 * Hides chat lines the Dungeon Chat Hider page marked Block — at the very last step, when the
 * chat GUI is about to add the line to its list (see ChatComponentMixin).
 *
 * That placement is the point. Everything else that reads chat — Odin's parsers, this mod's
 * own rotation, blade-addons, devonian, anything on Fabric's message events or the packet —
 * runs before the GUI, and none of it is touched: a hidden line is still received, still parsed
 * by every mod, still written to latest.log, it just never appears on screen. Cancelling a chat
 * event or the packet would have silenced the other mods too.
 *
 * Rules come from `chat/hidden.json` in the jar; drop a file of the same shape at
 * `config/engineerclient/chat-hider.json` to override without a rebuild (Reload Rules picks it up).
