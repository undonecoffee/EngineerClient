 * Which face of a box the view selects — pure maths, so it tests without the game.

 * A side is selected by looking through the box: the one the view leaves by, not the one it comes
 * in by, so a box seen head on selects its far side. It is where the view leaves *horizontally*
 * that counts, so looking down through a side or through the top still picks the side behind —
 * never the floor. Looking straight down picks nothing.
 *
 * The top is selected by looking up at its underside: the view, going up (past [TOP_PITCH]),
 * leaves the box through its top — from inside the box, or from below it. Standing inside and
 * looking up does too ([editsTop]).
