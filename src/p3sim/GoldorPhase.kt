/**
 * P3: Goldor, as measured on Hypixel (n = server ticks since "Who dares trespass into my domain?"):
 *  - four sections of terminals, levers and a device (7/8/7/7), counted in chat as Hypixel does;
 *    a later section's device done early counts for that section later;
 *  - between sections a gate (blown with Superboom or a Dungeonbreaker, only once its section is
 *    in progress; else it goes 5 s after the section ends) and a door that opens at the later of
 *    the section's last completion and its gate;
 *  - death ticks at n = 60k-1: anyone in the next section ahead (and S4 while S1 is in progress)
 *    is hit;
 *  - Goldor walks the track at 0.06/tick from (80, 119, 40), sprints to the section in progress
 *    (0.6) when he is still in the one whose door just opened, and after "The Core entrance is
 *    opening!" flies into the core (0.8) once everyone is inside (4 ticks after the opening at the
 *    earliest), and dies; his Frenzy hits you every 10 ticks 2-14 blocks from him there;
 *  - his lines go one at a time, each at least 62 ticks after the one before (a queue: intro,
 *    taunts, a random section line per door, the arrival script, "....");
 *  - Necron's first line 82 ticks (81-83) after Goldor's death, then P4; "Necron, forgive me." 82
 *    after "...." (with Necron's line when he died in flight, later when he reached the core).
 * [from] 1-4 starts at that section (the earlier ones done), 5 at the core opening.
