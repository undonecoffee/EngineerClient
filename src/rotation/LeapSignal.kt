/**
 * Who you should be leaping to, and whether it is time yet.
 *
 * Two stages, because those are two different questions:
 *
 *  - **soft** — the target is decided, so you know *who to click*. Known the moment the rotation
 *    hands you a role.
 *  - **ready** — that player has actually reached the section you are going to, so you know
 *    *when to click*. Leaping to an early-enterer before they are through is a wasted leap.
 *
 * Readiness comes from the arrival messages Odin's positional-message boxes send to party chat
 * (`/posmsg`, same config on every teammate), so every client hears it in the same order. Where
 * the strategy has no such message for a target, it falls back to watching their position — a
 * local judgement, so it can be late, but role assignment stays chat-driven either way and can
 * never desync.
