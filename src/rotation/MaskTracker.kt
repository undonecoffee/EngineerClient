/**
 * Who currently has an invincibility available. "Mask" is shorthand for all three types.
 *
 * VENDORED from Odin `InvincibilityTimer` — its `InvincibilityType` enum is private, so the
 * regexes and cooldown lengths are copied rather than called. Keep them in step when re-vendoring.
 *
 * Two sources, and they differ in what they can know:
 *
 *  - **Yourself**: the proc lines are sent only to you, so your own state is exact.
 *  - **Teammates**: Odin already announces every proc to party chat when "Announce Invincibility"
 *    is on (it is by default, and the party's logs show every member doing it), so a teammate's
 *    cooldowns can be followed without adding any traffic of our own. What that cannot reveal is
 *    which invincibility items a player actually *owns* — someone with no Bonzo mask never procs
 *    one, and looks indistinguishable from someone holding an unused one. So a teammate's count is
 *    an UPPER BOUND, which is exactly why the deciding player has to state their own qualification
 *    rather than have it inferred.
