/**
 * EC's own log: one file per game session under `logs/engineerclient/`, meant to be attached
 * as-is to a bug report when a run goes wrong. It is self-contained on purpose — every chat line the mod looked at is in it RAW, in
 * order, next to every decision the engine made from it, so a run can be replayed through the
 * engine offline and the first wrong decision found without a clip.
 *
 * One event per line: `HH:mm:ss.SSS <TAG> <payload>`, tab-separated.
 *
 *   SESSION  mod/spec/Odin versions, local player, starting role
 *   SETUP    the setup check, one line per item
 *   CHAT     a raw chat line, exactly as received (only while in a dungeon)
 *   SECTION  phase-3 section transitions
 *   ENGINE   the rotation engine's decision trail
 *   LEAP     leap cue: target chosen, became ready, and by which signal
 *   MASK     invincibility procs, mine and the party's
 *   ROLE     starting-role announcements heard
 *   MARK     a note typed by the player with /ec log mark
 *   WARN     anything the mod could not make sense of
 *
 * Free of Minecraft so the engine can write to it; with no file open every call is a no-op.
