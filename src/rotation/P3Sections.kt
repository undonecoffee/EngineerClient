/**
 * Where the four phase-3 sections are in the world.
 *
 * The F7/M7 boss room always generates at the same coordinates, so these need no calibration.
 * The boxes are inherited from the FatesLeap mod's `PhaseTracker` (same author, same floor) and
 * have not been independently re-measured — if a leap cue fires in the wrong section, these are
 * the first thing to check.
 *
 * This is only ever used for display timing: whether the person you are leaping to has actually
 * arrived. Role assignment stays entirely chat-driven, so a wrong box can make a highlight early
 * or late but can never desync who holds what.
